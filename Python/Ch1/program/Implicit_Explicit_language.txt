
All lanuages are 2 types
    1> Implicit
    2> Explicit 


1> Implicit Language :- 
        Here we don't have to express variable types

        Ex:- Python
         
         name = "Sandip"
         age = 20
          in this both case python detect automatically it's data type


2> Explicit Language :-
        Here we have to express data type before use any variable

        ex:- C, C++, java

        int age = 20;
        String name = "Sandip"

         Explicit languages can't detect automatically variable data type.
